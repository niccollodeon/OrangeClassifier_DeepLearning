## Orange Classifier in Deep Learning using EfficientNetB0

This repository is designed to help you understand how deep learning works in terms of classifying a specific image(as for my case, it's an orange fruit). In this code we will be focusing on using colab for users facing difficulties when training with their actual devices.

## Why use Google Colab?
-✅ Free & Easy Access to GPUs/TPUs
Provides free access to GPUs (T4, P100, etc.) and TPUs without needing expensive hardware.

No setup required—just open a notebook and start coding.

-✅ Cloud-Based & Accessible Anywhere
Runs in the browser, so you can access your work from any device.

No need to install Python, TensorFlow, or other libraries locally.

-✅ Pre-Installed Libraries
Comes with popular ML/DL libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV pre-installed.

Saves time on setup and dependency management.

-✅ Easy Collaboration
Works like Google Docs—share notebooks with others, allow comments, and edit together.

Great for team projects and academic work.

-✅ Supports Google Drive Integration
You can save files directly to Google Drive.

Useful for storing datasets, model checkpoints, and outputs.

-✅ Interactive & Supports Visualizations
Supports interactive widgets, graphs, and visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Great for data analysis and machine learning experiments.

-✅ Auto-Saves Progress
Your work is automatically saved to Google Drive, preventing accidental data loss.

Overall, It is for quick prototyping, learning, and small ML projects, Colab is one of the best free tools available
